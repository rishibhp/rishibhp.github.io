			These are notes and other things I have made for my classes. I find that I learn better when I type up my notes and thoughts. Unfortunately, it is also very easy to be lazy and focus on other things. Therefore I decided to (at least try and) keep a public set of notes to keep myself on the hook, so to speak, and who knows, maybe someone will find them useful. I find it helpful to phrase things in a way that might be found in a textbook where you try and explain things to the reader. Hence why that's what my notes tend to read like that. Most of the diagrams found in the notes were made using <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator">Desmos</a> or <a href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a>.
		</p>
		<p style="margin-bottom: 1%;">Note: I am very, very liable to make typos (forgetting prepositions seems to be a favourite of mine). If you spot a mistake, just let me know!</p>

            These are my notes from MAT415 from Winter 2024 with Professor Jacob Tsimerman. They are incomplete. I do not know if I will ever complete them.

        <p class="mat454_notes hidden">
            These are my notes from MAT454 which I completed in the winter of 2023 with Professor Edward Bierstone. MAT454 is the continuation of MAT354 and I had the same professor for both courses so there is some overlap in the early sections. Details omitted in this set of notes can often be found in the MAT354 notes.

			Here lie my incomplete set of notes for MAT347. These are from the first few weeks of classes. Almost certainly they will remain incomplete for a long time.

			These are my notes for MAT267. I think I have managed to correct most of the major errors (and a good proportion of the minor ones!), although if you find a mistake please do send me a message. If you are going to be taking MAT267, I hope you find these at least somewhat useful :)

		<p class="csc263_notes hidden">
			Here are my (essentially complete) notes for CSC263. There are perhaps a few diagrams that I could/should add but unfortunately I don't feel particularly motivated to do so. Overall, I'm afraid the quality of these notes is not as good as I would like but hopefully they are still useful. I blame the mediocre quality of the notes entirely on my other courses being too interesting and forcing me to spend more time on them.

		<p class="mat327_notes hidden"> The notes are made in collaboration with <a href="http://individual.utoronto.ca/arkaprava/">Arkaprava Choudhry</a> and are based on <i>Topology by James Munkres</i>, although some of the latter material also uses Allen Hatcher's freely available textbook, <a href="http://pi.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/AT.pdf">Algebraic Topology</a>. They are <i>mostly</i> complete (the latter half needs a bit more work, but it's hard to find time >_<).

			These are worksheets I created for a study group for 257 (called a Recognised Study Group, hence the acronym). Finding/coming up with exercises is a nice exercise in and of itself and hopefully doing them is somewhat useful as well (p.s. yes, the naming is deliberate. The only thing more fun than consistency is inconsistency).

        <p class="handwritten_notes hidden">At some point I found the <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9n318r854rhh?hl=en-US&gl=US">Microsoft Journal app</a>. I actually enjoyed using it as opposed to things like OneNote so I started taking some notes on it. Something about having actual pages really worked for me. I also find it's easier to handwrite things than type them up (although at some point I would like to type these up to get them in a nice format). Also fair warning that a lot of these are incomplete and are works in progress.</p>

			These are various things I found noteworthy (ha, pun intended) that I thought worthwhile writing down but don't really have a place for them.

I wrote this essay before university and were I to write it again there are many, many things I would like to change about it. However at its kernel I think it contains something that might be useful to some. Also I am quite proud of what I wrote, even if in hindsight there could be (many, many) improvements.</p>
