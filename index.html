		<p>Hi! My name is Rishibh Prakash and I am a Master's student at the University of Toronto studying mathematics. I also did my undergraduate at the University of Toronto in mathematics (specialist) and computer science (major). I find the vast majority of things interesting and am always excited to learn more. I am currently working with <a href="https://www.math.toronto.edu/rafi/">Professor Kasra Rafi</a> and Richard Cao to study the boundary of the curve complex. </p>
		<p>Among these pages, you'll be able to find some of the different things I've worked on/am working on (e.g. notes from previous classes, some previous assignments, some of my writing, and even some crosswords I've made). Anything I have made, you are more than welcome to use and share without asking me for permission (although I would love to hear it if something I have made has turned out useful!).</p>
