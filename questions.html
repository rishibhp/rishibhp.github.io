    <h1>Bucket List of Questions</h1>

    <div style="margin-left:5%; margin-right:5%; margin-bottom:1%">
        This is a list of questions that I have either no answer to or no satisfactory answer to. Every so often I will try to work on a couple of them. I refuse to look them up (in some cases that's not even possible because the problem is with my own understanding of the material) but if you have a hint please let me know. 

        <ol>
            <li>Is every group the fundamental group of a topological space?</li>
            <ul>
                <li>A completely delightful question posed to me by two different people. Of all the questions here, this is the one that eats at me the most.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Is there a simple description for subsets $A$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$ where $\text{Bd}(\text{Bd}(A)) = \text{Bd}(A)$?</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Somehow feels like these should be 'nice' subsets since counterexamples seem to be subsets with lots of holes in them (e.g. $\mathbb{Q}$).</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Why is there no natural isomorphism from a finite dimensional vector space to its dual?</li>
            <ul>
                <li>I know that the answer lies somewhere in category theory. I don't know enough to know how.  </li>
            </ul>
            <li>What does it mean to say that the $K_0$ group of a field is the integers? How exactly does it relate to dimensions of a vector space? </li>
            <ul>
                <li>One of those cases where I can do the computation but I don't know what it means. This frustrates me.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Up to homeomorphism, there is a unique topological space that is non-empty, totally disconnected, perfect, compact and metrizable (the Cantor set). How far can we weaken the conditions so that uniqueness no longer holds? </li>
            <li>Does there exist a group $G$ such that $\text{Aut}(G)$ is trivial?</li>
        </ol>
        <hr>
        <h2>Answered</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Suppose $G, H$ are groups such that $G \times H \cong G$. Does this imply that $H$ is trivial?
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li> No. Suppose $G$ is a group. Then we can define $G_\infty := \prod_{i = 1}^\infty G = \{f: \mathbb{N} \to G\}$. We can make this a group by defining the operation pointwise. We then observe that $G_\infty \times G = G_\infty$. </li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
